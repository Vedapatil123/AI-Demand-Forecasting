# **AI-Enhanced Demand Forecasting for FMCG**

## **Project Overview**

Reducing stock-outs and minimizing holding costs is a major challenge for FMCG companies. This project applies AI-powered demand forecasting to predict daily sales volumes 30 days ahead, enabling better inventory management and cost savings.

## **Business Problem**

FMCG firms face frequent stock shortages and excess inventory due to unpredictable demand. These issues lead to lost sales revenue and higher storage costs. Accurate demand forecasting is critical to balance inventory levels efficiently.

## **Data and Tools**

* Dataset: Open FMCG sales data from Kaggle  
* Tools: Python, Prophet (Facebookâ€™s forecasting library), Tableau for visualization  
* Preprocessing: Data cleaning, date conversion, and feature extraction

## **Approach**

* Explored and visualized sales data to identify seasonality  
* Transformed data into format compatible with Prophet  
* Built, trained, and evaluated time-series forecasting model  
* Calculated Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as performance metric  
* Generated 30-day demand forecast and created visual dashboard mockup

## **Results**

* Achieved a baseline MAE of 221 units, meaning predictions are within 221 units of actual sales on average  
* Captured clear seasonal patterns influencing sales fluctuations  
* Delivered actionable 30-day forecasts for inventory planning

## **Business Impact**

This forecasting tool empowers FMCG supply chain teams to proactively adjust stock levels, reducing lost sales from stock-outs and lowering holding costs, driving profitability and efficiency.
